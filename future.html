<h2>Future Development</h2>
<p>To improve the smart gloveâ€™s practicality, future versions could use smaller microcontrollers to make it less bulky. 
    The circuits could be built into a double-layer glove design, placing the sensors and wires between two layers of breathable fabric to make the glove stronger and look better. 
    This setup would protect the parts more effectively while keeping the glove flexible, helping to solve the current problems of exposed wires and limited comfort.</p>
