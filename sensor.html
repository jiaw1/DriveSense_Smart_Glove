            <p>For instantly dialing an emergency contact, the user straightens the hand, then bends all fingers to touch the palm, and repeats this movement. 
                This is inspired by the universal hand gesture used to signal emergency or request help.</p>

            <strong>Gesture 7 - Repeat song</strong>
            <p>To set a song to repeat, the user presses the tip of the index finger with the thumb and releases it.

<p>To control media and phone functions using the wearable glove, we defined a set of hand gestures that correspond to specific commands. 
    These gestures were selected to be easy to perform using natural finger movements.</p>
<h5 id="sec2">2. Identifying Sensor Types</h5>
<p>In our designed gestures, the key to distinguishing between different gestures is recognizing whether each finger is bent or touching. 
    In this case, we utilized two methods of detection. 
    The first method is using contact sensors, which are placed on the fingertips and the palm (except for the thumb). 
    When a finger bends, the fingertip touches the palm, closing the circuit. 
    This change in resistance allows us to detect whether the finger is touching. 
    The second method involves using a bending sensor, which is directly placed on the finger. 
    When the finger bends and causes the bending sensor to deform, the resistance reading changes, enabling the detection of finger bending.</p>
<p>The only exception in the gestures is for controlling the increase/decrease of volume. 
    We aimed to achieve this through an intuitive sliding motion of the finger. 
    But later we used these piezo-resistive sensors in some other gestures to control different functions of our music player.</p>
<h5 id="sec3">3. Sensor Measurements</h5>
<p>All sensor readings are based on resistance values measured using Arduino analog pins. 
    We used two contact sensors, which work like switches. 
    When they are touched, the circuit closes, and the resistance value drops immediately. 
    Normally, their resistance is around 900 Ω, but when contact is made, it drops to a range of 100 Ω to 300 Ω. 
    These values were consistent across both contact sensors.</p>
<p>Next, we used two bending sensors that we knitted ourselves using resistive yarn. 
    Their resistance changes when the yarn is stretched or bent. 
    When not stretched, the resistance usually stays between 850 Ω and 950 Ω. 
    When stretched during finger bending, the resistance drops to around 600 Ω to 800 Ω. 
    The exact values depend on the hand size of the person wearing the glove. 
    For example, when worn by male users, the sensors stretch more, so resistance drops further.</p>
<p>We also used three piezoresistive sensors. Their resistance also changes when pressure is applied. 
    Due to slight differences in the way each sensor was laminated, their readings vary a bit. 
    The first sensor has a resting resistance of around 800 Ω, which drops to 650–750 Ω when pressed. 
    The second one is usually between 750 Ω and 800 Ω when not pressed and drops to around 700–730 Ω under pressure. 
    The third sensor stays between 850 Ω and 900 Ω when not pressed and drops to 750–800 Ω when pressed. 
    These readings helped us define the thresholds for gesture detection in the Arduino code.</p>
