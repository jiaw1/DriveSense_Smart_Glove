<h5>1. Comfort and Wearability</h5>
<p>One of the first challenges we faced was ensuring the glove was comfortable to wear. 
    In our initial design, we stitched the glove inside out to hide the wires and sensors. 
    Although this helped with the appearance, it made the glove uncomfortable for the user, as they could feel the components pressing against their skin.</p>
<p>To solve this, we added an extra layer of soft fabric on the inner side of the glove. 
    This layer covered all the resistors, sensors, and wires, making the glove more comfortable without affecting its functionality.</p>
<h5>2. Durability of Conductive Connections</h5>
<p>We originally used conductive yarns to connect the sensors to the Arduino. 
    However, these yarns were not stretchable. During testing or when users wore the glove, the yarns would often break. 
    This made the glove unreliable and required us to rebuild the circuit multiple times.</p>
<p>We first tried using very thin, coated electrical wires. 
    These wires were more durable and did not short-circuit when touching each other. 
    However, they were less flexible, and bending the glove sometimes caused them to snap.</p>
<p>Next, we used coated conductive yarn. 
    While this helped avoid short circuits, the yarn still broke under tension, especially when the glove was being worn or removed.</p>
<p>Our final and successful solution was to cut long, thin strips from stretchable conductive fabric. 
    These strips were conductive, soft, and flexible, which made them suitable for stitching. 
    They did not break even after multiple uses and significantly improved the overall durability and comfort of the glove.</p>
<h5>3. Integration of Arduino and Battery</h5>
<p>Another challenge was to attach the Arduino and battery in a way that kept them hidden and lightweight. 
    Initially, we designed a small case using a 3D printer to hold both components. 
    While this solution worked functionally, it did not look good and added weight to the glove.</p>
<p>To improve this, we stitched a stretchable wristband onto the glove and placed the Arduino and battery inside it. 
    This made the hardware part of the glove itself, improving both the appearance and usability.</p>
