<p>In todayâ€™s world of smart technology, we are moving toward a future where vehicles become more autonomous and drivers are looking for safer and more user-friendly ways to interact with their car systems. 
    Our project idea is DriveSense smart glove that uses e-textile technology to enable gesture-controlled media interaction without the need to touch any screens or buttons.</p>
<p>With DriveSense, you no longer need to reach for your phone or touch any buttons to change the music. 
    Simple hand gestures while wearing the smart glove can easily control these functions with no distractions, such as play, pause, or even call. 
    Whether it is driving on the highway or in city traffic, it enhances the experience by allowing the driver to focus on the road while maintaining control over entertainment and media systems. 
    DriveSense is a perfect blend of comfort, efficiency, and next-gen automotive control.</p>
<p>This project was done for Aalto University's course ELEC-E7840 Smart Wearables in spring 2025.
    The code for the machine learning model and the user interface can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/jiaw1/DriveSense_Smart_Glove">here</a>.</p>
<p>Below is a short video that demonstrates the functions of our glove.</p>
